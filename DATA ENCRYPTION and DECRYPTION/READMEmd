# Overview
The File Encryption and Decryption Tool is a C# console application designed to help users securely encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption. It allows users to select a file, enter a password, and either encrypt or decrypt the file accordingly. This tool ensures data confidentiality by making sure that only the correct password can decrypt the file.

The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data, making it secure to store and share files.
