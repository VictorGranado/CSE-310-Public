# Overview

This data analysis application is designed to allow users to import datasets, perform basic analytical operations (such as statistical analysis, data visualization, and data cleaning), and export the results. The application provides a user-friendly interface for importing datasets in common formats such as CSV and Excel, and allows users to perform statistical calculations like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. It also provides options for cleaning missing data and removing outliers using the Z-score method.

The purpose of this software is to help users perform basic data analysis tasks with minimal effort, giving them the ability to visualize and clean their data, and then export the cleaned data for further use.
