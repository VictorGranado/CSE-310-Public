# Hydroponics Monitoring App

This mobile app is designed to allow users to monitor environmental conditions in a hydroponic system, including temperature, humidity, and water level. The app provides real-time data readings from an ESP32 board, which collects sensor data and sends it to the app via Wi-Fi. The app displays this information in a clean and easy-to-read format, with an option to view historical data.

The purpose of this app is to enable users to keep track of the health of their hydroponics system remotely, helping them maintain optimal growing conditions with minimal effort.

# Features

- Real-Time Monitoring: The app displays live readings of temperature, humidity, and water levels from the hydroponics system.
- History View: Users can access historical data to monitor changes in environmental conditions over time.
- User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a simple and intuitive layout for easy navigation and real-time display of key metrics.
